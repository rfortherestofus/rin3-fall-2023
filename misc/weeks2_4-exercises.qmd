# Analyzing the Palmer Penguins data

```{r packages}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

```{r data}
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
data <- clean_names(penguins_raw)
```


## Context

The Palmer Penguins data comes from a long-term ecological experiment in the Palmer Archipelago. This archipelago is located in Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman.

<!--- Make the figure below look better! Try to replace it for a better one, add a border, re-align it... Play with it!--->

## Population metrics

```{r calculate population metrics}


```


In the _________ island there were <!---insert here the number of individuals studied in the first island---> individuals, while in the _________ island there were <!---insert here the number of individuals studied in the second island--->, and in the _________ island there were <!---insert here the number of individuals studied in the third island--->.

In these islands, there is a mean of `$mean_males_per_island` males per island. This number is very `similar/different` from the number of females per island, which is `$mean_females_per_island`. See the table below to see a comparison of the numbers of males and females per island:

Here is a plot with the number of individuals of each species per island:

## Body metrics differences

There is a clear difference between penguins metrics between species. Below we can see a scatterplot of the bill length and depth metrics by species (Adelie in <span style="color:blue;">blue</span>, Gentoo in <span style="color:orange;">orange</span>, and Chinstrap in <span style="color:purple;">purple</span>). 

<!--- insert a scatterplot here. EXTRA: add a line across the points that is the approximate linear regression model that describes this variation.---> 
```{r metrics per species}

```

The difference between these metrics per island, however, is not that clear:
