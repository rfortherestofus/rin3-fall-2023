## How R handles NA values

- SPSS has named NA values

- In R, a value is only NA if it shows up in red (in the console) or light gray (in Quarto)

## How R handles NA values

You'll learn later to use functions from the `tidyr` package to deal with missing values:

- `replace_na()` will replace existing `NA` values with your chosen values

- `na_if()` will replace values you specify with `NA`

## NA values

> Is there some way to change the default behavior of summarize so that it ignores NAs without having to specify it specifically? I didn't know if there was something like a global variable that you can set in the R script file, or something within the RStudio environment or installed package?

::: {.notes}
Don't want to make your code not reproducible

Gracielle: Yes! It’s common that people just drop the NAs and sometimes they are actually important 0s. I see that all the time on species occurrence data, where NAs are often used interchangeably for “we didn’t sample there” and “we sampled there but no species were found”.

Libby: Are we missing a lot of values for "income" in our survey? Why? Which demographics are most likely to having missing income values? If we drop all these rows, are we now excluding a whole population group simply because they're less likely to disclose income on a survey?

## Quotes

## Needed to refer to non-existent things

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Not needed to refer to existing things 

::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)
```
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  select(island)
```
:::

## Needed when you're referring to text

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  filter(island == "Torgersen")
```

## Or the name of a file

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins <- read_csv(file = "data-raw/penguins.csv")
```


## %in% operator

> I’m wondering if you know why one needs to concatenate multiple observations in the filter function. For example, here’s a correct use of filter:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  filter(island %in% c("Torgersen", "Biscoe"))
```

## %in% operator

> From what I understand of the concatenate function (from Excel), wouldn’t that basically mean R is looking at each observation in island and seeing if that observation can be found anywhere inside "TorgersenBiscoe"? But when I try it without concatenating by doing this:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  filter(island %in% c("TorgersenBiscoe"))
```

> I get an error message. Maybe the answer is "That’s just how R works," but I’m trying to build a solid mental model for these functions, so if there’s anything more to it, I’d love to better understand. Thanks!

## Crosstabs

```{r}
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  tabyl(species, island)
```

## Crosstabs

```{r}
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  count(species, island)
```

# `case_when()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
penguins |>
  mutate(weight_category = case_when(
    body_mass_g > 4000 ~ "Over 4000 grams",
    body_mass_g < 4000 & body_mass_g >= 3500 ~ "Between 3500 and 4000 grams",
    body_mass_g < 3500 ~ "Less than 3500 grams"
  )) |> 
  select(body_mass_g, weight_category)
```


## How to change view outputs

```{r}
penguins |>
  select(species, island) |> 
  view()
```

## How to change view outputs

```{r}
penguins |>
  select(species, island) |> 
  print(n = 100)
```

## Valid column names

## Not valid

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  mutate(How cute = "Very cute")
```

## Valid

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  mutate(`How cute` = "Very cute")
```

## Not valid

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  mutate(3 = "Very cute")
```

## Valid

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
penguins |> 
  mutate(`3` = "Very cute")
```

## `clean_names()`

Use `clean_names()` to get valid and easy to work with column names

## Sequential summaries

> I'm just curious, so feel free to ignore if this is covered later. But, you mentioned that piping sequential summarizes into each other doesn't work to get a single table with multiple columns. Is there a way to do that? I didn't know if mutate would be able to handle taking in a tibble from summarize? I was guessing there must be some other way to combine tibbles? For example, if you were getting the mean bill length from the penguins data, but also wanted to get a mean bill length from some other bird dataset, and have these in the same table side by side (I googled it and it looked like there's a merge() function, but I didn't know if that was the best way to go about it in this case)
